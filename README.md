#TopoJSON.NET [![NuGet Version](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/TopoJSON.NET.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TopoJSON.NET/)

TopoJSON.Net is a fork of Jörg Battermann's wonderful GeoJSON.Net library. It extends the original lib with TopoJSON features and uses [Newtonsoft Json.NET](http://json.codeplex.com) converters for serialization and deserialization.

##What's in this version?
The current release features *only* deserialization (which might be buggy and I'll write more tests once I have the time). Serialization will come in the next weeks.

##Installation & Usage
Well all you basically have to do is install the [TopoJSON.Net](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TopoJSON.Net/) NuGet package:

`PM> Install-Package TopoJSON.Net`

## Contributing
